This is a news website project built with Spring Boot, where users can create accounts and share their own public posts. The website provides features such as:

User authentication and authorization: users can create accounts, log in and log out, and edit their profiles.
Post management: users can create, edit, and delete their own posts, and view posts created by other users.
User roles: there are two types of users, regular users and admins, with different levels of access and permissions.
The project is built using the following technologies and tools:

Spring Boot: a popular Java framework for building web applications.
Spring Security: a powerful security framework for authentication and authorization.
Thymeleaf: a modern template engine for building HTML5 templates.
